                     <p>By: Magtanong, Jasmine F.</p>
                    <p>There are films that stay in your head for a few hours, and there are films that settle in your chest like a secret. **All About Lily Chou-Chou** belongs to the second kind. When I watched it, I didn’t expect to feel seen in such a haunting, uncomfortable way. It’s not just a movie about adolescence; it is adolescence: fragmented, lonely, beautiful, and violent all at once.</p>
                    <p>The story centers on Yuichi, a quiet boy whose life is slowly unraveling. His escape is the music of Lily Chou-Chou, an enigmatic pop star whose songs speak of the Ether, a mysterious force that connects people beyond the physical world. Through an online fan forum, Yuichi finds a space where he can exist without fear. In that space, names disappear and only thoughts remain. That feeling of being able to speak without being seen was something I deeply understood. I’ve felt it in comment sections, in anonymous posts, in old message boards where I once shared pieces of myself.</p>

                            <p>The film drifts between timelines and tones, and its structure mirrors the messiness of memory. Nothing is ever fully explained. We are simply made to witness. The violence that Yuichi and his classmates endure isn’t always shown up close, but it is deeply felt. A girl is assaulted. A boy is humiliated. A friend becomes an enemy. Many of these moments are quiet and slow, and that silence is what hurts most. The world around them keeps turning, as if nothing happened.</p>

                    <p>What struck me the most was how quickly innocence collapses. Hoshino, who once laughed with Yuichi, returns from summer break as someone else entirely. His transformation is subtle at first, a change in posture, a shift in tone, but soon, it becomes terrifying. He leads the bullying. He inflicts pain with ease. No explanation is given, and maybe none is needed. People break quietly, and sometimes they do not recover.</p>

                            <p>Lily’s music plays throughout the film like a distant voice calling from somewhere softer. Her songs don’t save anyone, but they offer brief moments of comfort. That’s what art sometimes does. It doesn’t fix things, but it makes the weight easier to carry. There’s a scene where Yuichi stands in a field, listening to Lily through his headphones. The grass moves. The sky darkens. He says nothing, but everything is said.</p>
                            <p>Like Yuichi, I’ve had moments where music felt like the only thing keeping me afloat. The way he idolized Lily Chou-Chou reminded me of how I used to cling to songs and artists during times when I couldn’t explain what I was feeling. It wasn’t just about escape; it was about finding a language for my own silence, a place where I could feel understood without needing to speak. There’s something oddly healing about projecting your pain onto someone else's art, as if the artist somehow carried a piece of your burden. Watching this film made me realize that idolization, while fragile and sometimes isolating, can also be a form of quiet survival.</p>
