                    <p>By: Ocampo, Hans Christian</p>
                    <p>Christopher Nolan’s **Oppenheimer** is a beauty of a film; it isn’t just a biopic from the man himself, Robert J Oppenheimer, but we get to peek into the inner mind of Oppenheimer—his ambitions, his guilt, and his obsessions throughout his journey in the creation of the Atomic Bomb.</p>
                    <p>Nolan really captured the psychology of what a man eventually becomes when he loses himself in the pursuit of a new world and how it affects not only himself but the people around him and encapsulated it in one neat three-hour film for us to enjoy.</p>

                    <p>Robert J Oppenheimer, both in history and on screen, is a brilliant man with great ambitions for the world. Even before his eventual creation of the A-Bomb, he was already dreaming of the wider universe and how one can harness it.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>The film starts off with him retelling his entire life, from the humble beginning of his scientific pursuits till his eventual indictment to determine if he’s guilty of divulging classified information. Oppenheimer is shown as studious, academically inclined, but often gets lost in his theories, preferring to think about what could happen instead of actually manifesting into reality the places he visits in his head. **Cillian Murphy** portrays this man so well, the push and pull between brilliance and existential dread.</p>
                            <p>The movie also takes place in two timelines, jumping between one after the other throughout the film. In the 1940s, his scientific ascent that led to the creation of Trinity (the very first completed A-Bomb) and the 1960s, his political fight to stop the proliferation, progression, and propagation of nuclear arsenal in all the countries involved in World War 2.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>If you’re an enjoyer of torturing a protagonist like me, then this one isn’t for you, but it does tell you how Oppenheimer’s mind degenerates as the man who helped create world-ending weapons through guilt from having all that blood on his hands. It’s a dissection of responsibility and blame.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image reverse">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>In this film, Oppenheimer’s political radicalism is very much toned down. He has been shown here as more sympathetic to causes and having an intellectual understanding of them rather than actually engaging with them. His political inclination is what mostly sets him up for involvement in the Manhattan Project, but also the reason why he’s indicted in the first place.</p>
                            <p>What I loved about the film is that it doesn’t lean on loud sounds or visual artistry all that much, like other Nolan films—cough *Interstellar* cough. What he does deliver is the unmaking of a man, all with that Christopher Nolan pizzazz.</p>

                        <div class="image-block">

                    </div>

                    <p>They also didn’t lean too much on Oppenheimer’s most famous quote, “I have become death, destroyer of worlds,” mentioning it probably once or twice in the film. A good example of “show, not tell” storytelling but with a lot of dialogues.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, my very personal and totally unbiased opinion—*Oppenheimer*, the film, isn’t just a great watch, a mere three hours of your time drowning in Nolan-style epic. You’re investing a time well spent for the true story of a man who helped shape a world viewed through psychological profiling, the very man whose ambition became his obsession.</p>
