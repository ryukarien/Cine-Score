                     <p>By: Martin,Masato</p>
                    <p>In an era dominated by hyperrealistic cinema and slick digital aesthetics, **Cleaners**, a 2019 Filipino film directed by Glenn Barit, boldly rebels. With its rotoscoped, photocopied visuals and unapologetically analog heart, the film is not just a nostalgic homage to high school adolescence in 2000s Tuguegarao—it’s an existential probe into the hypocrisies of conformity, the quiet rebellion of youth, and the bittersweet erosion of idealism.</p>
                    <p>What makes **Cleaners** immediately striking is its visual technique. Every frame was printed on paper, hand-marked with highlighter pens, then scanned back into film, creating a jarring yet captivating DIY aesthetic. This labor-intensive style is more than a gimmick—it reflects the very soul of the film: raw, imperfect, and human. Like the titular student cleaners—tasked with keeping their school pristine while wrestling with their own "dirt"—the film exposes how society often demands order while denying the chaotic truths of identity, belief, and adolescence.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>Barit weaves together several loosely connected vignettes, each following a different student whose personal journey mirrors a deeper commentary on societal pressure. There’s the devout girl shamed for her bodily functions, the political rebel forced into silence, the perfectionist haunted by her mother’s expectations, and the misfit duo pushing against the limits of masculinity and image. Each story is layered with symbolism and restraint, refusing to offer clear resolutions. Instead, **Cleaners** captures moments of rupture—small, personal acts of resistance that echo larger truths about Filipino youth.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>What elevates the film beyond a coming-of-age story is its critique of moral cleanliness. The characters are not simply growing up; they are trying to remain true in a world that demands they be clean, both physically and ideologically. The term "cleaners" becomes metaphorical, revealing how institutions—schools, families, churches—attempt to "sanitize" young people, suppressing their contradictions, their questions, their dirt. In this sense, the film becomes a lament for lost authenticity and a cry against oppressive systems of purity.</p>

                            <p>Barit does not portray adolescence with romanticism, but with brutal honesty and ironic wit. His characters are neither heroes nor victims. They are uncertain, awkward, morally gray—beautifully human. Through his use of visual noise and analog imperfection, Barit reminds us that memory, like identity, is constructed and constantly overwritten. We are all rotoscoped beings—edited, colored, filtered—by time, by culture, by fear.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>**Cleaners** is not a film for passive viewing. It asks the audience to confront their own compromises, their past selves, and the spaces where they once colored inside the lines. It challenges us to remember the rules we followed, the ones we broke, and the dirt we tried to hide. In the end, it’s not just a story about students cleaning their classrooms—it’s about all of us trying to find clarity in a world that’s always drawing over us.</p>
                    <p>This film is a deeply personal yet universal reminder: growing up isn’t just about becoming clean—it’s about deciding which parts of yourself are worth getting dirty for.</p>
