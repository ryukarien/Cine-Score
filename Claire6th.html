                    <p>By: Ochoa, Bianca Claire</p>
                    <p>It takes courage to reboot and redefine a classic, especially when that classic is **Superman**, a character that has long been fleshed out and given an unspoken mold for his design, becoming the face of heroism, of hope. *Superman*, the movie, which was just released this year, takes the classic identity of the beloved superhero and peels back the layers of his character by asking a deeper, yet much needed question: What does it really mean to be a superhero?</p>
                    <p>We all have seen Superman before, whether it be from other movies, animated films, or live-action remakes, his image has left a recognizable impact on everyone. Superman—the last son of Krypton, the beacon of strength, virtue, invincibility—hope. It’s hard to deny that he’s the embodiment of the ideal superhero. While it may be the case in most films, *Superman (2025)*, takes this character and introduces a raw, ultimately more human side of the hero himself.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>This specific movie is less about Superman as the invisible, all-powerful hero, and more about **Kal-El**, the man behind the otherworldly strength. It completely discards the god-like reputation of Superman and emphasizes the deeper, raw side of his story. The Superman that is Kal-El, Clark Kent, the adopted son of Jonathan and Martha Kent, the alien striving to be a man in a world that wants to see him as something more than that. This version of Superman is not perfect. He wasn’t born with the purpose of saving people and doing good. In fact, he wasn’t even sent to earth to do good in the first place. This movie twists the origin of Superman by making his arrival to Earth disturbingly different from the original concept.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>This movie redefines Superman’s title, the **Symbol of Hope**, not as something he got because he was destined to, but as a title that he earned through the conscious decisions and sacrifices he made to do good. This choice was made even more meaningful when the truth of his parents’ entire message revealed that the intention of sending Superman to Earth was to not save, but to conquer the planet and rebuild Krypton. The fact that Superman didn’t even know about his parents’ true intentions prior to doing good speaks volumes, because it never crossed his mind to do such acts to Earth. He didn’t consider using his powers and superiority because it just wasn’t in his right to do so.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image reverse">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>The choice becomes even harder to follow through when the truth of Superman’s origin is revealed to the public. Once the public learned that Superman was never sent to Earth to be a savor—but to be a conqueror, everything about him crumbles. The world, the people that once saw him as the protector, their symbol of hope, now saw him as a threat. Regardless of these good deeds and actions, everything about him was put into question. Was it all just to groom the public into accepting him? Was he simply buying onto the good side of the people?</p>
                            <p>That is the central point of this film. Superman does not fight for praise and approval; he fights because he wants to, because he sees humanity as it was and wants to protect it. He believes in the world even when it doesn’t believe in him. That is exactly what makes Superman a hero—not because of his powers, his influence, but because of his resilience that pushes him to protect a world that wants nothing to do with him, the world that wants to put him down.</p>
