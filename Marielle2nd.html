                     <p>By: Datu, Marielle </p>
                    <p>Imagine a Fabergé egg — shiny, fancy, and beautiful, but empty inside. That’s what **Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery** feels like at first. Rian Johnson’s 2022 sequel to Knives Out brings us a murder mystery that looks fun and glamorous on the outside, but hides something deeper underneath.</p>
                    <p>This time, the story doesn’t happen in a dark old mansion. Instead, it takes place on a sunny private island in Greece, owned by a rich tech billionaire named Miles Bron (played by Edward Norton). He invites his group of friends for a fun murder mystery weekend. But these “friends” aren’t just ordinary people — they’re influencers, politicians, scientists, and business leaders, all chasing power and hiding secrets.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, the famous detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) appears. No one knows why he’s there — until someone ends up really dead. The weekend turns from a game into a real mystery filled with secrets, lies, and danger.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>What makes **Glass Onion** exciting is how it mixes humor, suspense, and social commentary. The characters are exaggerated versions of people we know: a clueless celebrity, a loud YouTuber, a fake activist, and a billionaire who thinks money makes him smart. They all act like friends, but they’re really looking out for themselves.</p>
                            <p>The story doesn’t just ask “who did it?” — it also asks why these people act fake. Every scene reveals a little more, showing that the rich and famous often have ugly secrets behind their smiles. The movie slowly peels back the truth, just like peeling an onion. And yes — it stings a little.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="image-block">

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Daniel Craig returns as Benoit Blanc, and he’s even better this time. He’s clever, funny, and always one step ahead. Janelle Monáe also stands out in a surprising and emotional role. The rest of the cast — including Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista, Kathryn Hahn, and Leslie Odom Jr. — bring energy, comedy, and tension to the film.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image reverse">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>The visuals are stunning. From the fancy glass mansion to the wide ocean views, everything looks rich and modern. But just like the story, all that beauty hides something rotten underneath.</p>
                            <p>What makes the movie more than just a mystery is how it reflects today’s world. It makes fun of tech billionaires with big promises but little substance, influencers who talk a lot but say nothing, and fake friendships based on convenience. It’s funny, but also a little uncomfortable — because these types of people feel familiar. We see them on social media, in news stories, or maybe even in real life.</p>

                        <div class="image-block">

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>By the end, **Glass Onion** doesn’t just reveal the killer. It reveals the truth about everyone. And like the title suggests, the more you peel back, the more your eyes begin to sting.</p>
                    <p>This movie proves that a murder mystery doesn’t have to be dark and serious to be powerful. It can be colorful, over-the-top, and still say something meaningful. It’s a wild, fun ride that keeps you guessing — and thinking — until the very end.</p>
                    <p>Just like a Fabergé egg, it sparkles on the outside. But what’s inside is what truly matters.</p>
