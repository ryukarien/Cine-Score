                    <p>By: Ivan Salamat</p>
                    <p>**Bullet Train** is a wild ride. From the start, it throws you into a fast-moving story full of assassins, strange coincidences, and unexpected humor, all set on one of Japan’s famous high-speed trains. I didn’t expect much at first, but by the end, I found myself really enjoying the chaos.</p>

                    <p>The story follows **Ladybug**, played by Brad Pitt. He’s a “lucky but unlucky” hitman who just wants a simple job for once. But nothing ever goes his way. All he has to do is grab a briefcase and get off the train. Easy, right? Not really. Other assassins are also on board, and they all have their own reasons for being there. One small job turns into a chain of events that no one can stop.</p>

                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>What I liked most about **Bullet Train** is how it mixes action with comedy. The fights are fun to watch, but the characters are what really make it work. **Lemon and Tangerine**, a pair of hitmen who argue like brothers, are probably my favorite. Their conversations feel silly at times, but somehow they also bring out real feelings. Lemon, with his love for Thomas the Tank Engine, adds a weird but clever layer to the movie.</p>
                            <p>Even though the movie jumps around a lot, it still manages to stay focused. The flashbacks, the different points of view, and the many twists could have made it confusing. But somehow, it all comes together in a way that makes sense. It’s not too deep, but it doesn’t need to be. It knows what it is and sticks to it.</p>

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The train setting adds to the fun. It gives the movie a tight, almost video game-like feel. Every time the characters move to a new car, something new happens. The close space keeps the energy up and makes the fights more intense.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image reverse">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>There are also small moments that give the movie some heart. Even though these people are killers, they have their own struggles. They talk about fate, luck, and trying to change their lives. The movie doesn’t dive too deep into these ideas, but it hints at them just enough.</p>
                            <p>In the end, **Bullet Train** is not trying to be a serious film. It’s fun, fast, and full of energy. If you’re looking for something to make you think hard, this probably isn’t it. But if you want something exciting with funny moments and cool characters, this movie delivers. It’s the kind of film you watch when you just want to enjoy the ride.</p>
