                    <p>By: Ochoa, Bianca Venice L.</p>
                    <p>I’ve always struggled to immerse myself in movies within the superhero/superpower genre, due to how repetitive and predictable some of them can get. The usual black and white thing, where there’s a clear distinction between the hero and the villain set at the very start, gets tiring after watching hundreds of movies follow the same thing. There’s also the tendency for it to become shallow and too power-centric, to the point that the plot and character development get lost due to the movie’s focus on showing off how great their CGI is with their action scenes. Paired with the professional cinematic recording style, superpower films just tend to become impersonal and completely unrelatable.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>**Chronicle**, however, starts differently by introducing the film’s different recording style, found footage. Whereas movies in the same genre would usually record in third person to showcase the protagonist’s ability, here we have a more personal view of what it feels like to wield it. The movie introduces us to our main protagonist, Andrew, a completely average and unremarkable teenager who has just picked up the hobby of videography. Not even a few seconds later, we find out why. He wanted to record everything in the daily life of a normal teenager, like getting beaten up by your dad and taking care of a mom who is terminally ill. The movie does a great job of immersing the watcher in the life of someone so miserable, having a first-person view (kudos to Andrew’s camera) of what it feels like to be tormented daily.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Throughout the beginning and up to the middle portion of the movie, clips of Andrew constantly getting bullied and just taking it, form an image of someone meek, who is used to being pushed around and dismissed. However, clips of him taking care of his mother, worrying over his cousin Matt’s safety, also form an image of someone inherently good. The movie picks up when Andrew, along with his soon-to-be friend Steve and Matt, discover a strange hole in the ground. And as teenagers who do dumb things, they crawl inside and ignore Andrew’s attempts to stop them. Deep inside, they get exposed to an unnatural crystal, and after long exposure, pass out.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image reverse">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>The movie resumes with a timeskip, where they’ve clearly been spending time using their newly gained abilities, telekinesis, and messing around with it in an unserious way you’d only see in teenagers who have no idea of the responsibility they just shouldered. They grow more and more reckless, using them carelessly in public, and Andrew, who is so used to feeling weak and beaten by his peers, gets too high on the feeling and endangers a man’s life by using his powers to swerve the car off the road and into a river. This scene marks the start of Andrew’s fast descent into madness, and his delusion that his ability makes him above everyone else. And Andrew, unknowingly, just started the track to his own demise.</p>
                            <p>The movie’s unique pacing and choice of direction are something I find very refreshing, since most movies want to portray their protagonist as someone good and unstoppable, overcoming their challenges and always staying victorious. But in Chronicle, we see Andrew, who at the start was someone good, slowly get shaped into someone vengeful, through the hands of his father, and ultimately, himself. The film stays true to how a person, who is constantly being mistreated by the world and so accustomed to living a hellish life, would react when given the power that could make them fight back.</p>
