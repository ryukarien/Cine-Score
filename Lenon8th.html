                    <p>By: Danielle Laurence Lenon</p>
                    <p>Waking up in an open, isolated area feels like opening a new season with **Open Season**.</p>
                    <p>A grizzly bear that weighs 900 pounds, named **Boog**. Then, there exists a mule deer named **Elliot**. With **Shaw** having associations with the Open Season, the flow became more interesting to me because his motive is to hunt animals, especially in his hunting ground. With that, he demonstrates no mercy and is selfish, no matter how animals express in their minds.</p>
                    <p>As the flow progressed even further, Boog led himself on an unexpected journey in the wild. Thus, Boog and Elliot spent more time with each other in the woods. He felt ups and downs with Elliot due to his first time stepping out of his comfort zone.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>Ups and downs are the core experiences in our lives, where we learn how things get done and deliver a series of events that can serve as memories. When thriving in the woods, resources are more limited than in the town. Independence is one of the values that helps us distinguish experiences and lessons to inspire us even better. However, sometimes independence can lead to improper judgment about the situation; sometimes we tend to think quickly and ahead without being aware of the consequences. Thus, it leads to a disconnection in the flow, which can be a little abrupt.</p>
                            <p>With independence, sometimes assuming oneself can lead to a significant change afterward, thanks to one of the funniest scenes I have witnessed, where going downward can pull us upward. For instance, exposing ourselves to a more dangerous area multiplies our problems, while solutions act as multiplicands for bridging the mystery parts.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="image-block">
                            <img src="poster/tooBbYCvrIvZ2ROPSbso69KtdDU.webp" alt="Boog and Elliot venturing through the forest." loading="lazy">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>The funniest scenes became more exciting ones, which involved being comfortable in the environment while overcoming problems altogether. For instance, bright scenes can lead us to hopelessness, while motivating us to stand up and show courage and confidence in overcoming danger.</p>
                    <p>Boog and Elliot became more comfortable in the woods while they encountered several animals. Thus, we can gain interpersonal values due to the keyword "several." From Boog living in Timberline to the woods is a decent scenario because he shows his transformation from intrapersonal to interpersonal life, whose sense of freedom becomes more evident, especially as he grows through more experiences.</p>

                    <div class="text-with-image reverse">
                        <div class="text-block">
                            <p>Gaining a sense of freedom requires determination and teamwork with Boog's combined experiences. Highlighting the keyword "teamwork," Boog, Elliot, and several animals not only prepare themselves against Shaw but also against Shaw and several hunters.</p>
                            <p>Showcasing combined experiences is the most ultimate of all in the Open Season because we can convey that it's not about giving up but turning up the tables, especially in extreme situations. In other words, we must stand up to fight. In the case of Open Season, Boog, Elliot, and several animals fight against several hunters, including Shaw.</p>
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <p>**Open Season** is derived from the concept of animals and hunters fighting in an open setting, while delivering a lesson that we must protect wildlife and animals around us because they contribute to healthier ecosystems. Thus, animals bring a greener and more lively planet Earth, where several billions of us live. To whom do we demonstrate our gratefulness in these lessons? Shaw and several hunters. Together, they provide better climate change in subtle ways with Open Season!</p>
